# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository stores a Microsoft Access application as exported text artifacts (not as a binary `.accdb`).

- `modules/`: shared VBA modules and classes (`mdl_*.bas`, `*.cls`).
- `forms/`: Access forms, typically split into `*.bas` (layout), `*.cls` (code-behind), and `*.json` (metadata).
- `reports/`: report definitions with the same split pattern as forms.
- `tbldefs/`: table/view definitions (`T_*`, `vw*`).
- `menus/`, `images/`, `themes/`, `macros/`: UI assets and macro exports.
- Root metadata (`project.json`, `vbe-*.json`, `vcs-*.json`, `db-connection.json`) is generated by the Access VCS add-in and should stay in sync.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no CLI build pipeline in this repo; the build/import cycle is done in Microsoft Access (VCS Add-in 4.1.2).

- `git status` — check pending changes.
- `git diff -- modules/ forms/ reports/ tbldefs/` — review object-level edits.
- `rg --files forms modules reports tbldefs` — quickly locate exported objects.
- In Access: run **Full Export** before committing and **Import/Build** after pulling.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Keep `Option Compare Database` and `Option Explicit` at the top of VBA code files.
- Use existing indentation/alignment style (4-space indentation in procedure bodies).
- Follow current prefixes: `mdl` (modules), `F_` (forms), `PF_` (popup/helper forms), `UF_` (subforms), `B_`/`UB_` (reports), `T_` (tables), `vw` (views).
- Preserve Access-generated attributes/headers; do not hand-edit generated metadata unless necessary.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated tests are not present. Validate changes manually in Access:

- Run startup flow (`AutoExec`) and confirm database connectivity.
- Smoke test changed forms/reports (open, edit/save, print/export paths).
- Re-run affected SQL-backed actions and verify no runtime VBA errors.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history is currently minimal (`Initial commit`, `first commit`) and uses short one-line subjects. Continue with concise, imperative commit titles, ideally scoped (example: `forms: fix F_Adresse save validation`).

PRs should include: affected objects, behavior change summary, manual test steps/results, linked issue (if any), and screenshots for UI/layout changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Never commit secrets. Keep `db-connection.json` on trusted-connection settings only, and avoid embedding usernames/passwords or environment-specific local paths in exported code.
